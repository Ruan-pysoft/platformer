 - move file-level `static` state variables into class variables
 - move some variables from `globals` to some config class – eg. allow dynamic window resizing
 - win screen
 - pause screen
 - separate collision detection from handling
 - timer
 - more levels
 - death count
 - checkpoints
 - un-singleton `Player`
   – see how this interacts with the input manager / actions?
 - move over to nob.h for build system
 - menus: settings menu, level select menu
 - ! gameplay instructions (how-to menu)
 - level selector
 - level unlocks
 - stars for levels (based on time + deaths; maybe a special achievement for completing deathless & with a short time?)
 - pb tracker per level
 - collectables, power-ups, moving hazards & platforms
 - respawn & level reset keys (perhaps level reset through menu?)
 - audio & art
 - ? scene transitions (fade...?)
 - add config file & parsing
