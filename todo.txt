 - move some variables from `globals` to some config class â€“ eg. allow dynamic window resizing
 - separate collision detection from handling
 - more levels
 - checkpoints
 - menus: settings menu
 - ! gameplay instructions (how-to menu)
 - level unlocks
 - stars for levels (based on time + deaths; maybe a special achievement for completing deathless & with a short time?)
 - pb tracker per level
 - collectables, power-ups, moving hazards & platforms
 - audio & art -- don't know if I do want to do art; lot of effort and I don't know if I'll get results. Meanwhile this flat colours aesthetic is growing on me
 - ? scene transitions (fade...?)
