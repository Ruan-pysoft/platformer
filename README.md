# A Platformer Game in Raylib

My submission for our CMPG121 project (2025).

## Documentation

Features are documented in [`features.md`](./features.md), program architecture is documented in [`architecture.md`](./architecture.md).

I plan on adding slideshows soon.

I will also add comments to the headers and (more selectively) source files.

## Licensing

This library is set free under the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/).
This means that it is released into the public domain
for all to use as they see fit.
Use it in a way I'll approve of,
use it in a way I won't,
doesn't make much of a difference to me.

I only ask (as a request in the name of common courtesy,
**not** as a legal requirement of any sort)
that you do not claim this work as your own
but credit me as appropriate.

Also, this *is* a university project, so I'll just note here that while copying this project and claiming it as your own might not be *illegal*, it would still be plagiarism and subject to university disciplinary procedures. So don't try passing it off as your own project, because it's not.
